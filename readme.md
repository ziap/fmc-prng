# Folded Multiply-with-Carry PRNG

An implementation of Marsaglia's Multiply-With-Carry generators, with an extra
scrambling operation of folding the upper and lower halves of the
multiplication result.

## Usage

If you just want the generator, here it is in C, porting to other languages
should be pretty trivial. See [Fmc256.zig](src/Fmc256.zig) for a Zig version.

```c
typedef struct {
  uint64_t state[3];
  uint64_t carry;
} Fmc256;

#define MUL 0xffff1aa1c69c8d92

Fmc256 Fmc256_new(uint64_t seed[4]) {
  Fmc256 rng;
  memcpy(&rng, seed, sizeof(rng));
  rng.carry = rng.carry % (MUL - 2) + 1;
  return rng;
}

uint64_t Fmc256_next(Fmc256 *rng) {
  uint64_t result = rng->state[2] ^ rng->carry;
  __uint128_t m = (__uint128_t)rng->state[0] * MUL + rng->carry;
  rng->state[0] = rng->state[1];
  rng->state[1] = rng->state[2];
  rng->state[2] = m;
  rng->carry = m >> 64;
  return result;
}
```

The rest of this repository contains code for configuring and testing the PRNG.
They are not important unless you want to reproduce the result or check for
correctness.

## Speed comparison

It's hard to evaluate the speed of PRNGs as there are many factors that affect
performance. But here's a rough estimation of how `Fmc256` performs against
some other popular PRNG.

Test environment:
- Zig version: 0.14.0
- OS: Linux 6.6.80, NixOS, 24.11 (Vicuna)
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800U

See [the source code](src/speed-test.zig) for more detail about the tests. We
can see that Fmc256 is in the same vicinity as the fastest generators in the
Hamming weight distribution test. For the Monte Carlo PI estimation test,
Fmc256 is only slower than small period generators (period less than 2^128).
